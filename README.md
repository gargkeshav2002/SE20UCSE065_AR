How to run the application:<br>
Open this link in your phone: https://web.unitear.com/<br>
It will open unitear scanner, then scan the target image and see the magic, the world of space.<br>
Target Image to scan is saved as Target.png<br>
Other png files are the 2d images of 3d assets.<br>

I used unitear software which is a no coding platform for AR. I built the application in that and published it.<br>
I extracted the code, the web page for unitear, all the files are available in the repository.

Video file is too large to be uploaded here.
